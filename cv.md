I'm a full stack developer with 3+ years experience building and engineering solutions in technology for the web and mobile.
After leaving full time education, I have worked in sales and technology recruitment for 5 years leading me to my passion for technology and building things. 

Technology and programming offers an endless scope for learning, self development and working collaboratively which is a huge motivator for me.
I began making websites for small businesses, friends and family and quickly found myself programming in all of my spare time.
In 2017 I decided to change careers and take on the challenge of completing 3 months of 60+ hour weeks with Makers academy, one of the most selective developer bootcamps in the world. I have been enjoying every day as a software engineer since then.   

My ideal team environment is friendly, focused and hard working; it values clean code, best practices, and opportunities to upskill and grow.
